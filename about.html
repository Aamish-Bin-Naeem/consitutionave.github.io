      <h1><center>Why Called Constitution Ave?</center></h1>
  <p><center>Well, Constitution Ave is the name of road in Islamabad that leads to the Supreme Court of Pakistan. This also explains the tagline of this website – “the road to justice”. What name, other than “Constitution Ave”, can better justify a website that is dedicated to covering topics on law and justice? After all, to borrow from Supreme Court’s own words, the Supreme Court has to play the role of “a sentinel on the qui vive” in order to perform its duties to safeguarding the Constitution and the rule of law in Pakistan. Therefore, naming this website as “Constitution Ave” is our own humble attempt to dedicate it to the Supreme Court, to the custodian of justice in Pakistan.</center></p>
